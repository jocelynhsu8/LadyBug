# LadyBug
Project for Hack(H)er413 2021 Hackathon

### Our Mission
The LadyBug team (Jocelyn Hsu, Tinho Leong, and Sofia Reynoso) envisions a website developed specifically for women in tech. As minorities, women often feel discouraged pursuing a career in tech. We hope to change that by cultivating a platform connecting women around the world. From sharing internship and hackathon opportunities to various virtual communities of females in STEM, we hope to encourage other women to pursue their tech passions without their identities holding them back.

### What we've accomplished
- Jocelyn: Introduced Git into workflow, set up repo, developed index and internships/programs pages. First hackathon!
- Tinho: Implemented information and links relavant to the communities page, designed a wireframe for the site. First hackathon!
- Sofia: Developed index and hackathon pages, designed presentation, prepared submission video. Second hackathon!
